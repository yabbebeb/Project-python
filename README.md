Project Report Summary: QSAR Biodegradation Dataset

Dataset Characteristics:
Multivariate Dataset:
The dataset contains values for 41 molecular descriptors used to classify 1055 chemicals into two classes: ready and not ready biodegradable.
Subject Area:
Other (Chemoinformatics and QSAR - Quantitative Structure Activity Relationships).
Associated Tasks:
Classification.
Feature Types:
Integer, Real.
Dataset Information:
Origin:
The QSAR biodegradation dataset was built in the Milano Chemometrics and QSAR Research Group at the Universita degli Studi Milano â€“ Bicocca, Milano, Italy.
Funding:
The research leading to these results received funding from the European Community, Seventh Framework Programme [FP7/2007-2013], under Grant Agreement n. 238701 of Marie Curie ITN Environmental Chemoinformatics (ECO) project.
Data Source:
Biodegradation experimental values for 1055 chemicals were collected from the National Institute of Technology and Evaluation of Japan (NITE).




Objective:
Develop QSAR models to study the relationships between chemical structure and biodegradation of molecules.
Classification of molecules into ready (356) and not ready (699) biodegradable using k Nearest Neighbours, Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analysis, and Support Vector Machines.



Project Tasks and Code Implementation:





PowerPoint Presentation (25%):
Content Overview:
Problem Statement:
Begin with a clear articulation of the problem: classifying chemicals into ready and not ready biodegradable.
Dataset Description:
Introduce key dataset characteristics such as the number of instances (1055), features (41 molecular descriptors), and the target variable (nO).
Project Objectives:
Explain the primary objectives, including the development of QSAR models using various algorithms for classification.
Approach:
Outline the steps taken, including data preprocessing, visualization, modeling, and API transformation.
Variable Creation:
Feature Engineering:
Discuss any new features or transformations created. For example, in the Python code, a new feature 'C%_Squared' was introduced by squaring the values in the 'C%' column.
Contextual Relevance:
Dataset Origin and Funding:
Highlight the importance of the dataset's origin and funding, indicating credibility and significance.
QSAR Models Development:
Explain how the dataset has been crucial in developing QSAR models for studying chemical structure and biodegradation.
Provide an in-depth explanation of the problem, insights into variable creation, and the contextual relevance within the study.






Python Code Implementation:
- The dataset used to discriminate ready and not ready biodegradable molecules.

a) Data Pre-processing (20%):
Encoding, normalization, imputation, and other necessary pre-processing steps.


b) Data Visualization (20%):
Use libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn to visualize the relationships between variables and the target.
Example code snippets provided in a previous response.
Encoding:
Use Label Encoding for categorical variables, converting 'nO' to numeric values.
Normalization:


c) Modeling and Evaluation (20%):
Utilize scikit-learn library to try multiple algorithms, perform hyperparameter tuning through grid search, and compare model results using visualizations.
Normalization:
Apply StandardScaler to normalize numerical features like 'nCp', 'C%', 'NssssC'.
Imputation:
Handle missing values using SimpleImputer, replacing NaN values with mean for numerical features.


Model Transformation into API (5%):
Transform the chosen model into an API using Django or Flask by converting the python code.
